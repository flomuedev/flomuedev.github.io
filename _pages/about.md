I am an Assistant Professor for `Mobile Human-Computer Interaction` at TU Darmstadt. My research follows the vision of seamless `mobile interaction in and with the physical world`, where digital information, AI agents, and physical environments merge into a unified `eXtended Reality`. Towards this vision, I explore novel `interaction techniques` for mobile XR and `collaboration with AI` systems. My approach is informed by a deep understanding of `body-centric`, `tangible` and `haptic interfaces`, as well as strong technical expertise, aiming to make the interaction more efficient and accurate but also more enjoyable and fun.
